Blockstack: A Global Naming and Storage System Secured by Blockchains

"Because blockchains have no central points of trust or failure, they enable a new class of decentralized applications and services that minimize the degree to which users need to put trust in a single party, like a DNS root server or a root certificate authority."

"Many non-financial applications of blockchains imply the need for a naming system that securely binds names, which can be human-readable, to arbitrary values.

## Limitation
- Size
"Individual blockchain records are typically on the order of kilobytes and cannot hold much data."
- Latency
"Latency of creating and updating records is capped by the blockchain's write propagation and leader election protocol, and it is typically on the order of 10-40 minutes."
- Bootstrap
"New nodes need to independently audit the global log from the beginning: as the system makes forward progress, the time to bootstrap new nodes increases linearly."

## Key Contribution
- Size
"Blockstack separates its control and data plane considerations: it keeps only minimal metadata (namely, data hashes and state transitions) in the blockchain and uses external datastores for actual bulk storage."
- Bootstrap
"Blockstack enables fast bootstrapping of new nodes by using checkpointing and skip lists to limit the set of blocks that a new node must audit to get started."

- Consensus, Virtual Chain
"With Blockstack, we extend the single state machine model of blockchains to allow for arbitrary state machines without requiring consensus breaking changes in the underlying blockchain." ? \
"We present the design of Blockstack's logically seperate layer, virtualchain, which introduces novel new functionality to production blockchians without requiring any consensus-breaking changes from the underlying blockchain."

- Migration framework
Namecoin to Bitcoin

## Problem with small blockchain
- 51% Compute Power is easy to achieve compared to Bitcoin
### Potential Solution
Merged mining, reported failing in practice in this paper
- No incentive to upgrade consensus-breaking software
What is consensus-breaking?

## Namecoin
Map domain names to DNS records

## Bootstrapping Problem
"In the initial days of a new blockchain, it would be relatively easy for a single party to take it over, since the total compute power on the blockchain is not yet large enough to prevent this."
### Potential Solution
Merged Mining \
"where an alternate blockchain can allow Bitcoin miners to participate in the new network without requiring them to spend extra compute cycles." ? \
### Advantages
- Hard to censor
DNS pollution \
"A blockchain-based DNS is much harder to censor and registered names cannot be seized from owners without getting access to their respecive private keys."

## Design of Blockstack
"Blockstack is designed to implement a naming system with human-readable names in a layer above the blockchain."
### Challeges
- Data Storage
Where to store the data
"All nodes participating in the network need to maintain a **full** copy of the blockchain, limiting the total size of blockchains to waht current commodity hardware can support." \
Does it hurt to skip initial blocks??

- Slow Writes
New blocks need consensus
- Limited Bandwidth
- Endless Ledger
