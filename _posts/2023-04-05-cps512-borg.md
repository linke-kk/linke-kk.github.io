# Large-scale cluster management at Google with Borg

## The user perspective
Jobs --> one or more Tasks (run the same program) \\
Each job runs in one Borg **cell**, a set of machines that are managed as a unit  \\


### Workload
- Long-running services (should never go down), and handle short-lived latency-sensitive requests
E.g. Gmail, Google Docs, and web seach (production job)
- Batch jobs that take from a few seconds to a few days to complete
(Non-production job) or Ad-hoc

What the difference between allocation and usage?

### Datacenter Hierarchy
Site --> a collection of datacenter buidlings --> A set of clusters --> "The machines in a cell belong to a single cluster" "A cluster usually hosts one large cell and may have a few small-scale test or special-purpose cells."

The machines in a cell are heterogeneous \\
"Borg isolates users from most of these differences by determining where in a cell to run tasks, allocating their resources, instealling their programs and other dependencies, monitoring their health, and restarting them if they fail."

### Job Hierarchy
"Each task maps to a set of Linux processes running in a **container** on a machine."
Why not in Virtual Machines? Overhead
Why would a job have several tasks? \\

### Alloc
"A Borg alloc is a reserved set of resources on a machine in which one or more tasks can be run;"
### What happens when more work shows up than can be accommodated?
#### Priority 
"A high-priority task can obtain resources at the expense of a lower-priority one, even if that involves preempting (killing) the latter." \\
#### Quota
"Quota is used to decide which jobs to admit fro scheduling."

### Naming and Monitoring
BNS name forms the basis of the task's DNS name. \\
E.g. the fiftieth task in job jfoo owned by user ubar in cell cc would be reachable via 50.jfoo.ubar.cc.borg.google.com


## Borg Architecture
Borg Cell --> Machines + Borgmaster \\
Each Machine --> a Borglet

### Borg Master
Replicated 5 times: Paxos
### Scheduling
#### Worst-fit
try to find the most vacant machine \\
Drawback: Load is evenly distributed, making it hard to fit load with high resource need \\
Advantage: Good for load spike, elasticity
#### Best-fit
"try to fill machines as tightly as possible" \\
Drawback and advantage are opposite
#### Hybrid
Combine high-priority tasks with low-priority tasks, low priority tasks are preempted when load spikes. \\
If two high-priority tasks live together, which task to evict when load spikes?

### Borglet
Local borg agent that is present on every machine in a cell

## Resource Relamation
### Limit
Upper bound on the resources that each task should be granted
### Reclamation
"Rather than waster allocated resources that are not currently being consumed, we estimate how many resources a task will use and reclaim the rest for work that can tolerate lower-quality resources, such as batch jobs." \\
"The estimate is called the task's reservation, and is computed by the Borgmaster every few seconds, using fine-grained usage information captured by the Borglet."
Reservation(Dynamic Prediction) <= Limit (Static)
"The Borg scheduler uses limits to calculate feasibility for prod tasks." "For non-prod tasks, it uses the reservations of existing tasks so the new tasks can be scheduled into reclaimed resources."
