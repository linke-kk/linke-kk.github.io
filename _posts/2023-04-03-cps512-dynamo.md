# Dynamo: Amazon's Highly Available Key-value Store
"Dynamo sacrifices consistency under certain failure scenarios." \\
"It makes extensive use of **object versioning** and application-assisted conflict resolution in a manner that provides a novel interface for developers to use."
"Data is partitioned and replicated using consistent hashing, and consistency is facilitated by **object versioning**."

## Consistency
"Consistency is facilitated by **object versioning**." \\
"The consistency among replicas during updates is maintained by a quorum-like technique and a decentralized replica synchronization protocol." \\
Eventually-consistent \\

Stale write. \\
How to resolve conflict, when, and who?
### Who resolves conflict
#### Data Store
Choices are limited, e.g. "last write wins"
#### Application
E.g. can merge the conflicting versions of shopping carts and return a single unified shopping cart


## Support Stale Write
Fast write latency

## Partitioning and replication
### Partitioning
Consistent Hashing: Chord
#### Load Balancing
Multiple Virtual Nodes within one physical node
### Replication
Each node is responsible for multiple ranges.

## Data Versioning
Stale write -> "Write returns immediately without propagating to all replicas" \\
E.g. shopping cart differs in different replicas. Write operation is "add to cart" and "delete item from cart" \\
Write effect can be reconciled or merged. But how? \\





## System Architecture
### System Interface
- get(key)
- put(key, context, object)
#### Context
"The context encodes system metadata about the object that is opaque to the caller and includes information such as the version of the object."
#### Object

### Partition Algorithm
Chord + Virtual Nodes
### Replication
N nodes responsible for a range instead of 1
### Data Versioning
"Dynamo provides eventual consistency, which allows for updates to be propagated to all replicas asynchronously." \\
Possible outcome: "A subsequent get() operation may return an object that does not have the latest updates." 

#### Stale Write
"If the most recent state of the cart is unavailable, and a user makes changes to an older version of the cart, that change is still meaningful and should be preserved." \\
"But at the same time it shouldn't supersede the currently unavailable state of the cart, which itself may contain changes that should be preserved." \\
Since both replicas have updates that other replica does not have, which one is the state of the art? Assume no network partition or packet dropping, which state will get() return? \\ Both are considered state of the art. Both will be returned by get()


#### Vector Clock
a list of (node, counter) pairs \\
"context is basically vector clock, when you write, you have to provide the last version you have seen, when you put, you have to put the context back." \\
"In Dynamo, when a client wishes to update an object, it must specify which version it is updating." \\
"This is done by pasing the context it obtained from an earlier read operation, which contains the vector clock information." \\
Get(Key) ---> List<Value + Context (Vector clock, a.k.a. object version)> \\
Application Reconcile the conflict (E.g. merge) \\
Put(Key, Context, Updated_Value) The Context will be newer than all the context returned in the read \\
E.g. D3 ([Sx, 2], [Sy, 1]) D4 ([Sx, 2], [Sz, 1]) \\
D3 + D4 ---reconcile--> D5 ([Sx, 3], [Sy, 1], [Sz, 1])

#### Truncating vector clocks
Problem: Everytime data is operated by a node, the vector will be longer, making the vector clocks giant \\
What is the problem of truncating? \\
Can not tell the causal relationship. \\
Least recently used node is not handling this key any more --> LRU Strategy \\

#### Quorum read/write
N, R, W --> R + W > N \\
N: the number of healthy locations that is responsible for a key \\
R: the minimum number of nodes that must participate in a successful read operation \\
N: the minumum number of nodes that must participate in a successful write operation \\

#### Synchronization
Use Merkle tree to reduce traffic

### Membership
Gossip-based protocol \\
Eventually consistent view of membership 

### Failure Detection
Purely local notion of failure detection is entirely sufficient
