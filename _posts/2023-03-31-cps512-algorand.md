# Algorand: Scaling Byzantine Agreements for Cryptocurrencies
## Key Contributions
## Verifiable Random Functions
### Seed
#### Salt in Hash Functions
##### What is Salt
hash(password) --> hash(password, salt)
##### Where is Salt stored?
Along with the password hash in plaintext.
##### What can adversary do?
Know the hash as well as the salt
##### What can adversary do with them
Compute password plaintext by brute force using hash(trial, salt) == passwordHash \\
But failed trial can not be reused to crack other passwords because salt is different. \
##### What does salt buy us
Cracking each user's password **seperately** rather than in parallel. \\
Failed trial of other users **can not be reused**
